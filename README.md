# License-Plate-Recognition-App
The app is to detect any license plate of a car and be able to display it in a readable way. This will be helpful to be able to detect any license plate of a car that may have broken any rules and regulations of the traffic. It is also very helpful for the security of cars as it will be able to detect the license plate fo any car and will be able to detect it. The app contains two buttons. One button is the 'upload image' button. This button will open a file explorer from where you can upload the image for detecting it. The secon button is th 'predict license plate' button. When you click this different windows will open up in which it calibrates it by greying it, smoothening it etc. At the end of calibration a cropped and readable image will display in a separate window of the licens plate. The only problem you may face is that while calibrating you will have to close the windows of it showing the different calibration steps.
